# üì¨ Gmail Push Notifications via Google Cloud ‚Äì KT & Implementation Guide

This document outlines the architecture, configuration, and integration process for implementing Gmail push notifications. It also details key challenges encountered during development and the solutions implemented to create a robust and secure system.

## üöÄ Core Architecture

The system is designed to provide real-time email updates by leveraging Google Cloud Pub/Sub for push notifications.

1.  **User Authentication**: Users grant permission via Google OAuth 2.0, allowing the application to access their Gmail account. Access and refresh tokens are securely stored.
2.  **Initiate Watch**: The application subscribes to the user's inbox using the Gmail API's `watch` method. This tells Google to send a notification to a specific Pub/Sub topic whenever a new email arrives.
3.  **Pub/Sub Notification**: When a new email is received, the Gmail API publishes a message to the designated Pub/Sub topic.
4.  **Push to Backend**: The Pub/Sub subscription is configured to "push" this message to a secure HTTPS endpoint on our backend.
5.  **Fetch Email History**: The backend receives the notification, which contains the user's email address and a new `historyId`. It then uses the Gmail API's `history.list` method to fetch all changes since the last known `historyId`.
6.  **Process & Store**: The application processes the new email data, encrypts sensitive content, and stores it in the database, linking it to the user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Initial Setup & Configuration

### 1. Enable Google Cloud APIs
-   **Action**: In the Google Cloud Console, enable the **Gmail API** and **Cloud Pub/Sub API** for your project.

### 2. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
-   **Action**: In **APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials**, create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** for a "Web Application".
-   **Configuration**:
    -   Add your backend's callback URL to "Authorized redirect URIs" (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback`).
    -   Configure the OAuth consent screen with the necessary scopes (`gmail.readonly`, `gmail.modify`).

### 3. Set Up Pub/Sub Topic & Subscription
-   **Action**: In the Pub/Sub section of the Google Cloud Console:
    1.  Create a **Topic** (e.g., `Gmail-Watch`).
    2.  Create a **Subscription** for that topic.
        -   **Delivery Type**: Set to **Push**.
        -   **Endpoint URL**: Provide your application's notification listener endpoint (e.g., `https://your-app.com/gmail/notifications`). This **must be a public HTTPS URL**.
-   **Permissions**:
    -   Grant the `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com` service account the **Pub/Sub Publisher** role on your topic. This is critical for allowing the Gmail API to publish messages.

## üß† Challenges Faced & Solutions

This section details the key technical hurdles encountered and how they were resolved.

### Challenge 1: Race Condition During User Setup
-   **Problem**: The `startGmailWatchService` was initially called immediately after a successful OAuth callback. However, the user's record was not yet created in our database. This caused the watch service to fail because it couldn't find a user to associate the watch configuration with.
-   **Log Signature**: `WARN: ‚ö†Ô∏è No user found with email: user@example.com` followed by `ERROR: ‚ùå Failed to save user config`.
-   **Solution**: The order of operations in `authController.js` was critical. We ensured the `retrieveOrRegisterUser` function is fully `await`ed *before* calling `startGmailWatchService`. This guarantees the user record exists in the database before we attempt to configure their Gmail watch settings.

    ```javascript
    // controllers/authController.js

    // 1. This must complete first!
    user = await retrieveOrRegisterUser(userData, jwtToken);
    logger.info(`üë§ User retrieved or registered: ${user.email}`);

    // 2. Now it's safe to start the watch service
    await startGmailWatchService(userData);
    ```

### Challenge 2: Missing Initial `historyId`
-   **Problem**: The `gmail.users.watch()` request sets up notifications for *future* events but doesn't provide the current state of the mailbox. Without the latest `historyId` at the time of setup, we couldn't fetch emails that might have arrived just before the watch was activated.
-   **Solution**: Immediately after creating the authenticated Gmail client, we make a call to the `Get Last 10 Mails` endpoint. This lightweight call returns the user's current messages and inside that recent  `historyId`, which we then save as the starting point for our first email sync.


### Challenge 3: Securely Storing Sensitive Email Data
-   **Problem**: Storing email content (from, to, subject, body, snippet) as plain text in the database is a significant security vulnerability.
-   **Solution**: We implemented a symmetric encryption layer using Node.js's built-in `crypto` module.
    -   An `encryptionBeforeStoring` function is called just before saving any email document.
    -   It iterates through a predefined list of sensitive fields (`from`, `to`, `subject`, `bodyPlain`, `bodyHtml`, `snippet`).
    -   Each field's value is encrypted using **AES-256-GCM** with an `ENCRYPTION_KEY` stored securely in environment variables.
    -   A corresponding `decryptField` function is used when retrieving data to be displayed to the user.

## ‚úÖ Final Implementation Flow

1.  **Authentication Route (`/auth/google/callback`)**:
    -   Receives user profile from Google.
    -   Calls `retrieveOrRegisterUser` to create or update the user in MongoDB, storing their tokens. **(Waits for completion)**.
    -   Calls `startGmailWatchService` to:
        -   Get the latest `historyId` from the user's profile.
        -   Initiate the Gmail `watch` request.
        -   Save the watch expiration and `historyId` to the `UserConfig` collection.
    -   Generates a JWT and sends it back to the client.

2.  **Notification Endpoint (`/gmail/notifications`)**:
    -   Receives push notifications from Pub/Sub.
    -   Decodes the base64-encoded message data to get the user's email and new `historyId`.
    -   Calls `getEmailsBetweenHistoryIds` with the old and new `historyId`.

3.  **Email Fetching Service (`getEmailsBetweenHistoryIds`)**:
    -   Uses the Gmail API's `history.list` method to get all new message IDs.
    -   For each message ID, calls `messages.get` to retrieve the full email content.
    -   Calls `encryptionBeforeStoring` to encrypt sensitive fields.
    -   Saves the processed and encrypted email data to the `emails` collection in MongoDB.
    -   Updates the `lastHistoryId` in the `UserConfig` collection.

## Appendix: Detailed IAM Permissions for Pub/Sub

This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to configure the necessary IAM (Identity and Access Management) permissions to allow the Gmail API to publish notifications to your Cloud Pub/Sub topic. This is a crucial step that is often overlooked.

**1. Navigate to Your Pub/Sub Topic**
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to the **Pub/Sub** section.
   - Click on the **Topics** tab and select the topic you created for Gmail notifications (e.g., `Gmail-Watch`).

**2. Add the Gmail Service Account as a Principal**
   - With your topic selected, look for the **Permissions** tab in the information panel on the right (you may need to click "SHOW INFO PANEL").
   - Click the **"ADD PRINCIPAL"** button.

**3. Configure the Principal and Role**
   - A new pane titled "Add principals" will appear.
   - In the **"New principals"** field, paste the following special service account provided by Google:
     ```
     gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com
     ```
   - In the **"Assign roles"** dropdown, search for and select the **`Pub/Sub Publisher`** role. This grants the Gmail service account the permission to *only* publish messages to your topic.

**4. Save the Permissions**
   - Click **"Save"**.

**Why is this required?**
Google Cloud operates on a "principle of least privilege" security model. By default, services cannot interact with each other. Granting the `Pub/Sub Publisher` role to the Gmail API's dedicated service account creates a secure, one-way communication channel. This ensures that the Gmail API is authorized to push notifications to your topic, and nothing more, protecting your infrastructure from unauthorized access.
