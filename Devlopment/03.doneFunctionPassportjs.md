- The done function in this context is a callback used by Passport.js authentication strategies. It signals the completion of the authentication process.

## How it works:

- When Passport.js calls your strategy's verification function (the part with (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => { ... }), it expects you to call done when you're finished processing the user.
- You typically call done(error, user):
    - If authentication succeeds, pass null for error and the user object: done(null, user).
    - If authentication fails, pass an error or false: done(error) or done(null, false).

- `If you forget to call done, Passport will hang and not complete authentication. Always ensure you call it once per authentication attempt.`
### Most Important
- Whatever you pass as the second argument to done(null, user) is what ends up as req.user in your callback route after authentication.

- As we are doing JWT then we don't need serializer and deserializer used for sesion mngmnt.
