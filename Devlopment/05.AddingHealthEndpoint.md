# Feature Summary: Health Endpoint and Cron Job for Access Token Revival

This document provides an overview of two new features implemented in the Velora application: a health check endpoint and an automated cron job for refreshing Google OAuth access tokens.

## 1. Health Check Endpoint

To improve monitoring and reliability, a new health check endpoint has been added to the server.

-   **Endpoint:** `GET /health`
-   **Purpose:** This endpoint provides a simple way to verify that the server is running and responsive. It is a standard practice for application monitoring and can be used by uptime monitoring services to check the application's health.
-   **Functionality:** When a request is made to the `/health` endpoint, the server responds with a `200 OK` status and a JSON message indicating that the server is "healthy". This confirms that the application is operational.

This feature was introduced as part of Pull Request #15.
